<p>The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges. Most of you are familiar with point of sale (POS) systems, even if you don't realize it.

<p>Also, since your revenues will rise, spending time on forecasting and analysis will have a bigger return on investment, so we added features of a POS system that will help you with forecasting as well. Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management.

The price, lower than most POS software services in the restaurant business, is also a big selling point.

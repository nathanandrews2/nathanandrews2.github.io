Choosing a POS software vendor that offers proprietary hardware can save you time while offering smoother functionality.

<p>Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store. Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business.

Fortunately, this is where a restaurant management software comes in handy.</p>

Refund the past orders to gift cards, store credit or back to the customer by using the original payment method. Most popular restaurant POS systems offer a free trial or demo of their product.

<p>Reports show a complete picture of restaurant operations and life cycles: menu consumption, reservation frequency, hours of high restaurant load, busiest tables, most active employees, payment methods, and automatic tax calculations. Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet ( at Google Pay) Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.</p>
<p>Any form of payment can be used, such as cash, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and even accumulated loyalty points. If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, or plan to expand your retail stores into the ecommerce space, then I highly recommend the Shopify POS system.

<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>

Whether your platform of choice is a traditional, PC-based point of sale system or a tablet POS system, the experts at pcAmerica can custom design a point of sale system to meet the unique needs of your business.</p>

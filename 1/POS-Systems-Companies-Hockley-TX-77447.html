<p>A point of sale machine is a computerized replacement for a cash register. Even if you don't employ delivery staff, these third-party services will order, pick up, and deliver the food, generating more sales with little additional work. For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost. Besides accepting credit and debit cards and cash, restaurants must accept gift cards and mobile payments to stay competitive.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>

<p>Labor Management and Payroll : A restaurant POS system can act as an employee time clock, with servers and staff signing in and out according to their schedules. In comparison, a customized restaurant POS system bundled with a restaurant POS PC and restaurant POS Software will allow your business do so much more. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong.</p>

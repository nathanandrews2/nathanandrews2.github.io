<p>Payment by check has historically offered an opportunity for fraud and lost revenues, but modern point of sale systems have introduced security tools to help minimize this possibility. Integrated employee time card systems schedule hours and generate payroll, and the inventory is intelligent and self-managing (set the items just one time and the inventory tracks and manages them from there on out, sending key alerts when items need to be reordered, and even printing order forms for vendors).</p>

A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur.

Retailers who meet this requirement first will build stronger relationships with customers, create space for innovation projects, and make more strategic decisions that maximize their growth.</p>

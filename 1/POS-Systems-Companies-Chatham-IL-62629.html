<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Delivery management: Manage order deliveries from start to finish, ensuring on-time customer delivery. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes. Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>
<h2>Hospitality POS (Point Of Sale) Systems & Software Chatham</h2>
<p>The answer is simple: by keeping track of the inventory and managing the profits earned through sales as efficiently and as accurately as possible, the business personnel can pour their individual attention to business growth and the increase of sales. Sync with QuickBooks 3. When you accept a payment, process a sale, or update your inventory, QuickBooks updates your books to save you time, effort, and potential errors.</p>
<p>Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit. As a result of such extreme competitive pressures, modern POS has evolved far beyond a payment and accounting system to become not just point of sale, but also point of service, driving highly individualized interactions that consistently gratify customers in the moment.</p>
<p>IVend POS helps retailers reward customer value across all channels with integrated store and online loyalty, allowing shoppers to accrue and redeem points in any channel. To make your decision easier, we have compiled list of the best bar POS systems, restaurant POS systems and POS systems that work for both bars and restaurants.

Better software systems allow for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and salesperson.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>Available on terminal and mobile devices, its multi-store, multi-user, eCommerce integrated, loyalty-ready capabilities make it easy to sell to your customers, and more importantly, keep them coming back. Mobile POS systems are gaining popularity in some customer-facing industries.

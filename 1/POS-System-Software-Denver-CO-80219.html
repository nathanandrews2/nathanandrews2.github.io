<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. Otherwise, your business's and your customers' financial information could be at risk. With handheld technology designed for the restaurant environment, you can enable your team to spend more time with guests, accelerate service, and speed up checkout through tableside ordering and payments. For the purposes of calculating the sales total and change due this makes perfect sense. We're talking about employee management, customer management, offline mode functionality, payroll management, customer management, etc.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>

Like our previous choice, TouchBistro is designed specifically for bars but also caters to breweries, cafes, pubs, and restaurants This POS solution offers mobility, cloud-based reporting, and excellent customer support among other advantages.</p>

<p>Marks and Spencer, a UK based retailer dealing in fashion and apparel, uses more than 16000 POS applications in its stores world wide. One associated benefit for restaurant owners is the elimination of miscommunication between customers, servers, and kitchen staff; Orders can be sent straight from the customer to the kitchen, increasing efficiency and reducing mistakes. Lightspeed is the best iPad POS system because its pricing is competitive, the system is fully mobile, and you have a choice of integrated payment processors.</p>

<p>Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports.

Modern POS vary widely, from hardware for scanning credit cards that connects directly to your smartphone, to complete systems with terminals and cash drawers.</p>
<p>The Lightspeed EPOS interface is generally user-friendly, but can sometimes be more advanced than intuitive i.e. you may rely on user guides to understand certain features.

<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control, and these features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems.</p>

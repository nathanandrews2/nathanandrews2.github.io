<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them. Cloud POS from an organization like Oracle gives you the benefit of millions of dollars of investment in data security hardware and software, which helps protect your guests and your business from hackers. This helps retailers keep track of their customers' purchases and allow them to serve them better.</p>
<p>It works with all major credit card processors and POS equipment. Customers can also interact directly with POS systems, particularly in the hospitality industry. Options like an online appointment calendar, appointment reminders, customer database with details for a previous haircut or nails styles, retail functionality, inventory management, online employee scheduling, and employee management are all vital to have.</p>

<p>When we consider a POS system, it has to be divided into hardware and software.

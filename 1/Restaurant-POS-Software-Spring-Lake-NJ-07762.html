For multiple terminals, additional PC server will be needed to consolidate all sales data and provide more sophisticate reporting to management. This POS system boasts special features for retailers operating hardware stores, pharmacies and boutiques. Offline Functionalities - Although your internet service provider probably guarantees an uninterrupted internet connection, you cannot afford to risk your restaurant business by taking their word for it.

<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell. For a while, on-site POS software has been the norm for computerised POS systems , but it is now more common to use cloud-based or hybrid systems relying on both the internet and local hosting. We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>

The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>

<p>Lightspeed Payments users receive one free payments terminal to use in their retail store. The QuickBooks POS or QuickBooks Point of Sale is software that works a notch above cash registers.

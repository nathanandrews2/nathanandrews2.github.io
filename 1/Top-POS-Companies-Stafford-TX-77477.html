<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. If the restaurant has primarily chosen a cloud-based POS system but their internet is not 100% reliable, they can connect an on-site server enabling the software to function when the internet is down and sync the data in the cloud when the internet is back up and running.</p>
<p>Smartwerks is cloud-based POS software for specialty retail such as gift and hobby shops, jewelry boutiques, and furniture stores. Jesta's Vision Store irons out your POS kinks so satisfaction and, in turn, sales grow.

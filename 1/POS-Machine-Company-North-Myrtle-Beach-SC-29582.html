In the hospitality industry a POS system is much better because of the different needs, requests, and reservations of customers.

<p>Depending on which POS you choose, it can also solve issues that arise when sales and inventory numbers don't match up. You can automate markdowns and track them accurately, eliminating the register receipts headache at the end of the day.

<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>

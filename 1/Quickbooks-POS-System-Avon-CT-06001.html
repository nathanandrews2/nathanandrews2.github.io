<p>Choosing your point of sale, or POS, systems could be a disaster if you approach the wrong dealer and go for the wrong equipment. This training is for you if you want to grow your business using a powerful customer experience formula proven to make your cash register chirp.

With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>

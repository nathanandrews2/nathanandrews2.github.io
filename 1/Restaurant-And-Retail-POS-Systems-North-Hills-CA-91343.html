The software in some systems runs only for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>Liquor costs in the restaurant and bar industry are typically 18-20% of total liquor sales The more you can optimize your liquor cost percentage, the more money your business will make.

We offer our point of sale software, hardware, menu programming, and installation with no upfront costs.</p>
<p>If you want control over your profit and loss, you need to start with a good inventory management function. Brigade POS was developed by a team of experienced restauranteurs and software innovators who wanted to address the 3 core problems inherent with almost every POS system: 1. Reliability. With each of these systems comes different hardware and capabilities from different brands, including hardware, software, and additional features.</p>

You either lose sales or have to rely on your cashiers to add and total your sales properly. But since the old-fashioned cash register first paired up with computers in the 1970s, POS has transformed into a powerful hub for financial, sales, promotional, and operational processes.</p>

The purpose was to keep employees and customers honest.</p>
<p>Employee management- The point of sale software administers the staffing levels, sales performance, and employee hours that ultimately help in tracking employee productivity. Sometimes the term POS may be used interchangeably with the term point of service, as customers may use the same technology to make returns.

<h3>Till System For Small Shop Warsaw Virginia</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>Integrated CRM performance within our retail pos system catches significant customers information and facts like buying selection and purchasing history, which usually allows long term cross-sell as well as up-sell possibilities with regard to multi-channel selling. The benefits of this system include reduced overhead for staffing, and also from reduced time that the customer must wait for checkout. This is the best option for those looking to expand their businesses- i.e. if you're looking to open and run two or more physical retail stores.</p>

<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>

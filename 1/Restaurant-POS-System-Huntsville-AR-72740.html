<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
<h2>MUST Ask Questions To Help You Select The Best Point Of Sale POS Retail Huntsville</h2>
<p>Well, the truth is, you need a systematic approach if you intend to sort through the overwhelming pile of POS systems , and select the most suitable one for your coffee shop or food truck business. In-Built Loyalty Management Module: Now you can manage contact details and food preferences of customers to offer them personalized offers. We updated our POS system page with a link to our customer payment study With more insight into how your customers want to pay, you're better equipped to pick the right POS option for your business.</p>
<p>It works just like any POS you'll find in a retail store, but because it's cloud based point of sale software (runs in a web browser) it works on any computer or iPad in the world.

<h2>POS Ordering System Huntsville AR</h2>
<p>You can use an array of tools to manage cash, inventory, orders, central product catalog, pricing and promotions, reports and dashboards, and customer information. Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems. A bar and grill, particularly a franchise where overhead is higher, properly tracking product popularity, sales and waste ultimately improves the overall bottom line of the restaurant.</p>
<p>We focus on making the software work with the best and most commonly used retail hardware and we've heard from retailers using Vend successfully with printers we've haven't heard of. Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>

<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. Linga POS is the best-value Cloud-based iPad POS for restaurants and bars. As a merchant, you need to be able to accept payments and track your sales in the easiest, fastest, and most secure and reliable way. Whether you need several POS hardware workstations, a single mobile POS, or multiple mobile devices, Brink software can adapt to your specific restaurant size and point of sale needs. With Lavu's system, restaurant and bar owners get complete control over operations and help staff deliver above-average customer service.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
<h2>Retail Pro Software Solutions Snohomish</h2>
<p>You can train your sales staff to keep an eye on queue length and whip out Retail Pro POS on a tablet to open up additional check stands so you make sure your customers get a good last impression.

Lavu can accept and process payments made through channels like contactless payment methods, magnetic stripe cards, and chip cards, making the payment process a breeze not only for users but for customers as well.

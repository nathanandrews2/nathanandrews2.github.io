<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. You can analyze sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly. Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>
<p>Features include sales snapshots, void reports by employee, detailed credit card payment reports and detailed shift reports. Multi-store businesses, such as chains or franchises, will have access to the hierarchy feature, which allows businesses to easily manage and control simple to complex organisational business structures with accompanying access privileges. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.</p>

<h2>Most Popular Point Of Sale Systems Petal MS</h2>
<p>Inventory Efficiency: The POS system allows you to view sales reports immediately. Capturing data at the time and place of sale. The other benefit to handling tips through a sophisticated POS system is, when tax season rolls around, your bar point of sale software can create a report that shows exactly how much your customers paid in tips. Payments can also take place directly in the Restaurant POS. NorthStar from Custom Business Solutions is an iPad POS system for quick- and full-service restaurants, cafes, bars, amusement parks, and cruise lines.</p>

<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system.

There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>

<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This means that, in order to access the capabilities that point of sale systems boast, you'll have to pay a fee to access the software that provides them.

<p>Heartland POS (formerly Dinerware) is a Global Payments company that offers multiple retail and restaurant POS systems for small and midsize businesses. Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions.

You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>

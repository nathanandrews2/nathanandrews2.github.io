<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>

Mobile apps have turned phones into portable payment kiosks, minimizing hardware requirements, while enabling retailers to take the transaction from the counter to the sales floor and beyond.

<h3>Point Of Sale Systems Of The Future Grayslake Illinois</h3>
<p>Although a POS system is an essential tool for any retail store, it shouldn't be the only one you have in your arsenal. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not.

<p>Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business.

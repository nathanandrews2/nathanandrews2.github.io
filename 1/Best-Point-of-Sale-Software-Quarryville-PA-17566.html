<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. Relying on an iPads is also a big perk, as it saves space and makes it easy for servers, hosts, managers, and bartenders to create and edit orders anywhere. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>
<h2>EPoS Systems In The Hospitality Industry Quarryville</h2>
<p>While other POS systems on the market encourage you to use your own devices, Revel strongly recommends that you buy hardware directly from them for everything to go smoothly. If you have been hesitant to install a POS system, or are simply curious as to what a POS system could bring to your restaurant, it's time to consider what they have to offer. POS transaction is the state where customers offer payment for the exchange of goods and services.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between POS systems and cash registers , but generally speaking, functionality is typically uniform across platforms in the sense that a POS machine is used to ring up sales and to accept payments.

<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up.

<p>The system features automatic invoicing, barcode scanning, debit card PIN processing and digital receipts.

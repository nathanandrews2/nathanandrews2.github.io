<p>If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders. Menu management lets you switch between different menus for different parts of the day, such as happy hour. Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores.</p>

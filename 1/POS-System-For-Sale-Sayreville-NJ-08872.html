<p>Most of us remember the early days when retail systems were just a cash register. Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. You can download and install Retail Plus POS software in a matter of minutes. By setting minimum stock number and restocking levels a restaurant can maximize their revenue by creating accurate orders that reflect the sales patterns the software reveals. ShopKeep helps small business owners focus on providing excellent customer service by minimizing the time it takes to complete routine tasks.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Our POS software for bars can help you run your business more efficiently and handle all your daily tasks free of stress. Staff insight:Advanced point of sale software can act as a time clock for staff, streamlining payroll, and improving accountability. An easy-to-use POS means streamlining and speeding up restaurant operations. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data.</p>

Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners.

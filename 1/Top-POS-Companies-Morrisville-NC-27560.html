<p>A point of sale system is a type of computer or specialized terminal that is used to instantly record a transaction. Organize menu items, categories, choice sets and modifiers to customize your restaurant POS to meet the needs and offerings of your restaurant. Advanced, cloud-based retail POS system that comes with integrated payments, inventory management, and real-time reporting. Stay in touch about new products, features, and ways to maximize your business with your new POS system. Modern POS systems are commonly programmable or allow enhancement with third-party software programs.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

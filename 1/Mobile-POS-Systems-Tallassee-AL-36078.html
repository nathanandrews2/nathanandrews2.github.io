<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>We only sell ruggedized POS hardware designed to meet the strenuous demands of busy restaurants. It is a comprehensive tool equipped with features ranging from order management and payment processing to CRM and loyalty program management. Point-of-sale(POS) systems are vital to running a successful business today. Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis. The Epos Now system-hardware bundle includes a touch screen terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and EMV card reader.</p>

<h3>How Does A POS System Work The Basics Explained Avondale Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>You have access to features like table management, delivery, and cash management. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Entry level systems begin at around $500 for the hardware and a monthly subscription price for the software of about $50. The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management.</p>

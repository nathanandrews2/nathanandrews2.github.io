Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions.

Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>
<p>POS hardware is the physical screen, tablet, or kiosk where staff enters the order. A handful will include analyzing sales, inputting customer contact information, centralized stock management and the ability to connect with smartphones. Not only does it serve as a virtual terminal with stored card capabilities, this well-rounded platform also helps you handle invoicing and recurring billing, scheduling, tip-splitting, inventory, dynamic custom menu building, and much more.</p>

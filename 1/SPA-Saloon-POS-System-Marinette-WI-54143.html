<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>

Epos Now is an award-winning POS system trusted by hospitality businesses like Best Western Hotels and Subway Restaurants.

Epos is easy to use so staff can start using the system almost immediately.</p>

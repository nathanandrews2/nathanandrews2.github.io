<p>Learn what features to look for when choosing the best retail POS system for your company. ChronitoPOS makes customer relationship management easy. Reprint this ticket 10 times and sell and collect for themselves these reprinted receipts instead of ringing up new customers. The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. Toast itself acts as the client's payment processor, and unlike many of its iOS-based competitors in the POS world, runs on Android operating systems, making it at once cheaper and more versatile.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

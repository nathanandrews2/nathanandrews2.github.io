STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits.

With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>

<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Technological advances such as point of sale systems, email ordering and computerized kitchens have taken fast service to a new level. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. ShopKeep can be used for payment processing, inventory management, transactions, customer marketing, staff management, reporting and analytics, and more.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

The system has an inventory tracker with item management, status updates and reports accessible through a variety of devices. Many of the leading POS-based restaurant management systems have a combination of useful functions, melding POS with back-office and front-end features.</p>
<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. These applications would typically provide the same core functions, so watch out for other things like the hardware you would need to purchase on top of the software or which mobile platform it runs on. You would also do well to keep a keen eye on vendor reputation for providing timely updates and customer service.</p>

<p>The only negative to implementing a new restaurant management system is the training time and challenge of learning new software.

Many Nordstrom Rack stores combine static register POS terminals with mobile POS systems to allow employees to reduce lines at their traditional register stations - one or two employees can clear half a dozen shoppers from a line in relatively little time.</p>

<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
<p>Thus, a retail owner should take a careful matching of POS softwares and hardwares. It's our fastest reader ever - processing payments in seconds - and it's easy to integrate with our POS software. You should choose cloud-based bar POS software that enables order taking, payment processing, employee management, inventory tracking, data recording and real-time reporting. If you're in need of a POS that has great robust inventory management built in to it then I suggest you give the Hike a test and consider it.</p>

It is Payment Card Industry Payment Application Data Security Standard (PCI PA-DSS) certified so you can ensure data security of your customers' payment information. PointOS is a POS system designed for restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>And many POS systems are capable of accepting almost any type of payment, including contactless payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay. That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>

<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon.

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>

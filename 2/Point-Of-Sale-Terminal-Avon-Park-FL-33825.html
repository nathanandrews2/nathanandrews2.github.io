<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business. It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments. Cloud-based, SaaS options mean retailers can spread costs over time, rather than make a large capital expenditure on a new system.</p>

We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales.</p>
<p>Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges.

<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city. There is only 1 thing we can think of that will drive customers away faster than bad food and that is slow service.</p>

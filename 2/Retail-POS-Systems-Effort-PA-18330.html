<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment.

<h2>The Small Retailer's Guide To Savvy Cash Management Effort</h2>

<p>With a kiosk module, you can set up tablets as self-service kiosks that customers can use at restaurants to place and pay for their orders and at retail businesses to scan and pay for their items. As technology has advanced, so have POS systems, with the introduction of bar codes in the 1970s, graphical interfaces in the 1980s, and online ordering in the 1990s. Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money.</p>
<p>Cloud-based POS systems that offer enterprise reporting give owners and managers secure access to detailed sales, inventory, and labor reports across all of their businesses or segmented for each individual location.

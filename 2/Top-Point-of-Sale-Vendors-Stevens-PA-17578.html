An administration software is present in the system and it includes electronic menu screens and monitors for easy order processing. They come with many automation functions so you can save time so you can grow your restaurant business.</p>
<p>On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

<p>Heartland POS (formerly Dinerware) is a Global Payments company that offers multiple retail and restaurant POS systems for small and midsize businesses. Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions.

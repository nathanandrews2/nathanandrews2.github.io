<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business. It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments. Cloud-based, SaaS options mean retailers can spread costs over time, rather than make a large capital expenditure on a new system.</p>

Our standard restaurant point of sale includes a touchscreen POS terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and kitchen printer.</p>
<p>Cross Channel returns management- The POS returns management system accepts the cross-channel returns and assists in refunds along with replacements from any type of store location. More importantly, however, the right POS system will allow bar and nightclub staff to spend less time in front of the screen and more time in front of customers, pouring delicious drinks. In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>Today, the best POS system for restaurants are well-optimized for the hospitality industry.

<h3>Restaurant Manager POS Warren Michigan</h3>
<p>With the Harbortouch Bar & Restaurant table management feature, you can see how many people are at a table, and see which tables are occupied or vacant. Armed with that information, you can reduce labor costs, increase your inventory's return on investment (ROI), predict high-volume sales periods, identify your star employees, and much more. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem.</p>
<p>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>

Expand your customer base, manage inventory and sales, and perform and monitor other functions at any time from anywhere.</p>
<p>Software as a service (SaaS) essentially allows business owners to access add-on products to existing computers over a robust internet connection, and are an economical alternative to hardware purchases.

As technology has advanced, so have POS systems, with the introduction of bar codes in the 1970s, graphical interfaces in the 1980s, and online ordering in the 1990s. Valuable reporting insights, ingredient-level inventory, and easy ordering will save you time and money.</p>

<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>Springboard is a powerful, cloud-based POS software and management system for retailers. Having actual connected data means your sales associate can save the sale by placing an order to the other store using send sale capabilities. There are hundreds of companies that exist only to provide their bar and restaurant software to you. In addition to Square's standard credit card processing capabilities, the restaurant POS system can also accept Google Pay and Apple Pay, even in the middle of an internet service outage.</p>

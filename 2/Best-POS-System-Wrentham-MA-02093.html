<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. As a result, POS systems can now be summed up as "cash registers on steroids." Even before the rise of mobile and cloud tech, POS systems took the basics of the cash register and expanded them to task directly to back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors The cloud has become a hot trend in this space because it has let many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) make use of advanced POS systems because they can avoid the ongoing expense of deploying and maintaining a back-end server at every location.</p>
<p>The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges. Most of you are familiar with point of sale (POS) systems, even if you don't realize it. Remote access: Some POS systems can act as bar and restaurant management software, allowing managers to view sales figures, stock data and much more, remotely. Whether you're serving drinks at happy hour, serving customers a quick meal or brewing up the latest imported coffee bean, eHopper is made for multiple types of small businesses.</p>

<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Infinity POS is always on and offers near real-time customer and offer information that staff can use to encourage purchase and upsell.

We've been assisting and simplifying the daily routine of retail businesses since 2001.</p>

Its rich features with no hidden fees make it lucrative for many small businesses. EPOS has a lot of very specific configuration options, perfectly suited for cafe, restaurant, and bar owners.

<p>Most of us remember the early days when retail systems were just a cash register. Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. You can download and install Retail Plus POS software in a matter of minutes. By setting minimum stock number and restocking levels a restaurant can maximize their revenue by creating accurate orders that reflect the sales patterns the software reveals. ShopKeep helps small business owners focus on providing excellent customer service by minimizing the time it takes to complete routine tasks.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

Integrated employee time card systems schedule hours and generate payroll, and the inventory is intelligent and self-managing (set the items just one time and the inventory tracks and manages them from there on out, sending key alerts when items need to be reordered, and even printing order forms for vendors).</p>

Or dive into the details with sales summaries and historical comparisons with more advanced, real-time reporting features.

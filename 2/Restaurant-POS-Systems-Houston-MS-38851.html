<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). All in all, I need something that will provide everything to make sales happen quickly, but protect the businesses interests most importantly.

Upon receiving a Square Chip Card Reader free of charge, customers are charged with flat rates.</p>

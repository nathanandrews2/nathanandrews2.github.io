<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years. But without inventory management software, it is exactly that: counting. Making big, bold investments in point of sale systems means establishing a single view of the customer, inventory, and order so that retailers can deliver the end-to-end experience customers expect.</p>
<p>You can then send them special offers and sale notices with Odoo Mailing Register tax identifications for your business customers and give them invoices instantly (or send by email). Mobile apps have turned phones into portable payment kiosks, minimizing hardware requirements, while enabling retailers to take the transaction from the counter to the sales floor and beyond. Point of sale represents the area where retail businesses conduct their most intensive data entry.</p>

Expand your customer base, manage inventory and sales, and perform and monitor other functions at any time from anywhere.</p>

Payments can also take place directly in the Restaurant POS. NorthStar from Custom Business Solutions is an iPad POS system for quick- and full-service restaurants, cafes, bars, amusement parks, and cruise lines.</p>

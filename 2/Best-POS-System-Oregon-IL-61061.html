<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor.

Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. However, if the system does not run reliably, it can cause serious headaches for both management and wait staff.</p>

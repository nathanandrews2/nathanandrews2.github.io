<p>The uAccept POS system from Workwell Technologies comes with a touchscreen, card reader, receipt printer and cash drawer. This can help attract repeat business and effectively help you market to interested customers. Since your ecommerce and in-store solution will be connected with Shopify POS, customers will have the ability to return or exchange an online purchase at a local retail location.

<p>Bluestore is a simple and affordable POS system that works on different types of hardware, including iPads. I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc.</p>

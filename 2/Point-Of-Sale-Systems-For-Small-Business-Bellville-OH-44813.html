<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>The platform comes equipped with a robust inventory management feature allowing you to customize categories and settings. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. A member database that supports targeted marketing such as coupons and points schemes has high value in increasing sales and keeping customers. System is hosted online, i.e. data are stored on your POS provider's internet servers, enabling you to access it from any computer browser.</p>

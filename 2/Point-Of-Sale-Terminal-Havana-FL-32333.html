Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments. A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service.

Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. Note that these fees are determined by the payment processor, not by the POS provider (although sometimes the POS provider will make you use their in-house payment processor).

<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>

Unlike the manual inventory system, a POS system can help you analyze your previous sales data and allow you to make better decisions about product reordering. As shrinkage due to customer theft and employee theft is one of the major expenses in most retail businesses, the modern retail POS technology has been geared toward preventing shrinkage.</p>
<p>The UnifiesPOS standard, to which all POS systems had to conform, was led by The National Retail Foundation. The staff management module makes managing your staff easy.

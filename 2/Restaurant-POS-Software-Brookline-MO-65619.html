Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more.

Beyond ringing up sales and accepting payments, you want a system that streamlines related processes such as inventory and customer management. A retail POS system may also include a barcode scanner and customer-facing screen.</p>

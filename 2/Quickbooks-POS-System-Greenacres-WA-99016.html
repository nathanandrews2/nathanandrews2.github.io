<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>

Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.

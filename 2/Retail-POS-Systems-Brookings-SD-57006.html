<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing.

The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

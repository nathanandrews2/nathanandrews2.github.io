It's affordable, easy to use and packed with features for all types of retail businesses, including fashion boutiques, car washes, computer shops, bike shops and other specialty stores.</p>
<p>For over 40 years, RSI's commitment to the growing and fast changing worlds of Retail, Hospitality and Security has allowed us to partner with multiple POS and Security providers, making it possible to have a POS solution for every type of business.

You don't need a valid internet connection to run this restaurant POS software. Payments can be by cash or credit and debit cards, or via convenient payment gateways. For example, allowing your vendors to monitor your inventory levels in real time through a POS system reduces - even eliminates - product shortages.</p>

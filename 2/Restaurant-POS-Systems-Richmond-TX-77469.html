In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Square for Restaurants is here: our built-from-scratch platform of software, hardware, and payments that streamlines your whole restaurant or bar operation. A cloud POS is an online or web-based POS which can be easily used with your existing hardware such as a computer, tablet, and printer.

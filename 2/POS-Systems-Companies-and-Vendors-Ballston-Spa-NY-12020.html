<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>

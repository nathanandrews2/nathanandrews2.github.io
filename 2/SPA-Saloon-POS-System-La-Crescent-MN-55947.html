<p>For most retailers, point of sale technology (POS) is fast becoming the best choice for increasing sales. Because the platform can speed up your processes and cut waiting times, customers get to have a richer experience and, therefore, improved satisfaction, which results in repeat business. This software facilitates ordering, billing, reporting, accounting, table tracking, and receipt printing for restaurants and bars. Dinerware's independent dealers have different pricing structures, but most have monthly support plans and the option to purchase or lease hardware, Dinerware Sales and Marketing Lead Madeline Stockwell says in an email.</p>

<p>In this age of GrubHub, Seamless, Postmates, and other food delivery apps, creating an online ordering presence may seem daunting if you don't want to affiliate with one of the larger digital dining services. The first thing you might ask is, "what exactly is the definition of a Retail Management System?" A retail management system (RMS), is essentially an integrated set of digital applications that the retailer uses to operate their business.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>

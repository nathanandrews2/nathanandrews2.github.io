<p>Agiliron is redefining retail point of sale. The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. A POS system can increase profits by providing a quick and reliable check-out process, maintain detailed sales and inventory reports, and provide integrated profit increasing programs such as loyalty programs, coupons, and special discount programs.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

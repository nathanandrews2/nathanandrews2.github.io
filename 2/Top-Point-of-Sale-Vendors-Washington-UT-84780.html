<p>You can use the Point of Sales system on both desktop computers and mobile devices. By empowering associates with technology and visibility to real-time inventory, purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, employees can not only save the sale with endless aisle capabilities, but they can also increase basket size and same-store sales.

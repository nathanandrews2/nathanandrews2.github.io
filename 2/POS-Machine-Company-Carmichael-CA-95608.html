<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. A POS system provides the latest sales reports for the day, week, month, or year. You'll want to use POS software that integrates seamlessly with your other systems and causes limited disruption. In essence, Upserve POS provides tools for customer management, restaurant management, table management, and specialty order processing. Some restaurant point of sale systems come standard with an "86 Item Countdown" feature that displays actual counts, deducts from the count when an item is sold and then prevents sales of the item once it is sold out.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information. Managers can also keep track of profits, inventory, menu trends, and other analytics.

However, a POS system like TouchBistro is more ideal for large-scale restaurants who need advanced features like detailed reporting and forecasting.

Its retail offerings include pcAmerica and LiquorPOS, and its restaurant options include Dinerware, Digital Dining and Xpient. Many small businesses prefer mobile POS hardware since it is typically less expensive and offers more flexibility. Nearly all retail operations in stores to day would be more time consuming and expensive to perform if it weren't for the power of a point of sale system.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems, as a result, are basically cash registers on steroids.” POS software expanded the basics of the cash register directly into credit card payment processors and back-end accounting. Since the point-of-sale system was now keeping an individual record for each inventory item, retailers wanted to maintain their stocking levels in the computer.

In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up. Your point of sale should help you automate and optimize how you manage your business's inventory.

<p>Manage your business with a robust iPad POS system. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.

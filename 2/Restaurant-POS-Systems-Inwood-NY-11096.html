<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Your customers become your shop's ultimate cheerleader, speaking positively about you within their social circles and essentially attracting new customers for you. Consolidate your inventory, customer, and staff management across all locations so that you can manage your entire business from one place. Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. POS systems also offer reliable add-ons and hardware systems such as barcode scanners, cash drawers, receipt printers, and card swipers.</p>

<p>The software integrates with QuickBooks Desktop financial software, ecommerce platforms, and other POS systems.

<p>There is usually a form of payment involved to complete the transaction, such as credit cards, cash, debit cards, EMV, and mobile payments. Employee Reporting and Management: The performance of your employees can make or break the success of your store. They can have retail shop features such as color and size matrixing, inventory tracking, employee commissions, gift registry, customer database, layaway, and purchase orders.</p>
<p>Good retail management software should print barcode labels in two sizes and can automatically print a label for every item in the last shipment. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>

Many Nordstrom Rack stores combine static register POS terminals with mobile POS systems to allow employees to reduce lines at their traditional register stations - one or two employees can clear half a dozen shoppers from a line in relatively little time.</p>

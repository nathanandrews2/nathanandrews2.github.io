<p>Updating your point of sale (POS) systems can help you to provide better customer service, increase your stock control, increase staff efficiency, reduce theft at the point of sale, and provide customers with more information. Otherwise, your business's and your customers' financial information could be at risk. With handheld technology designed for the restaurant environment, you can enable your team to spend more time with guests, accelerate service, and speed up checkout through tableside ordering and payments. For the purposes of calculating the sales total and change due this makes perfect sense. We're talking about employee management, customer management, offline mode functionality, payroll management, customer management, etc.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores. This all-inclusive system is a platform for staff management, inventory control, back office management, reporting, and marketing. Now how the software works is that every time an item is scanned it will be deducted from the inventory database.</p>

With Mink Foodiee in-depth reporting and analytics, view real-time reports from anywhere, anytime, and make quick data-driven decisions for your restaurant. It's a great choice for people running a business both online and face-to-face, but the backend and frontend may feel more cumbersome than other POS systems designed for face-to-face sales primarily.</p>
<p>Cost- Before finalizing the POS system, the user should consider the cost of it that includes the hardware and software price. This software has been around since 2008 and continues to be one of the best POS systems for retail. To get started, pair your POS software with one of our top inventory management software options. A vital element of POS hardware is the cash drawer. Payment is easy - at the beginning of the night, servers can start a tab in the POS for each customer, adding their name and payment card information so they don't have to ask again, allowing customers more convenience when they spend an evening in your bar.</p>

When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>
<p>You'll need to consider software for restaurant and bar inventory, purchase and invoicing, accounting, reservation, and scheduling. While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online.

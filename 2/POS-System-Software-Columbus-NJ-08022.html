<p>Streamline data from all selling platforms into one location, allowing you to spend more time making business decisions that grow your business. At the bare minimum, you need a bar POS system that's capable of handling split payments. Former nightclub and restaurant manager, Seth Harris, developed Upserve with specialty ordering and table and customer management.

<p>Orders can be taken tableside and are sent directly from the waiting staff to the kitchen - meaning staff no longer have to wait for an open terminal to complete the order which cuts down the time between customers ordering and receiving their food.

Chris Ligan, vice president of acquisitions at credit card processing company Auric , listed a few must-haves that every business, bar or otherwise, should look for in a POS system.

<p>All businesses required to comply must obtain a certificate from the cash register system provider which certifies that the system meets these requirements.

As mentioned above, locally-installed systems can only be accessed at the physical location of the servers whereas, with a cloud-based system, you could theoretically keep an eye on your sales on a beach in Hawaii if you felt the urge.</p>

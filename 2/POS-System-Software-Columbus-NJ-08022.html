Former nightclub and restaurant manager, Seth Harris, developed Upserve with specialty ordering and table and customer management.

Chris Ligan, vice president of acquisitions at credit card processing company Auric , listed a few must-haves that every business, bar or otherwise, should look for in a POS system.

As mentioned above, locally-installed systems can only be accessed at the physical location of the servers whereas, with a cloud-based system, you could theoretically keep an eye on your sales on a beach in Hawaii if you felt the urge.</p>

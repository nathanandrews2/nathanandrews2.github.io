<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity.

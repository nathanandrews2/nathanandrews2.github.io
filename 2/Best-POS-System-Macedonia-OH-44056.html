Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business.

<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction.

Advanced features of KORONA's automation and retail inventory management helps you identify and resolve problems to improve business operations.</p>

Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Restaurant is another reliable POS system that streamlines the hospitality experience for both venue managers and their clients.

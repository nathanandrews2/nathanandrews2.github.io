<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
<p>So when you're at your favorite restaurant or retail shop, and you make a purchase, you are completing a point-of-sale (POS) or a point of purchase (POP) transaction.

Many small businesses prefer mobile POS hardware since it is typically less expensive and offers more flexibility. Nearly all retail operations in stores to day would be more time consuming and expensive to perform if it weren't for the power of a point of sale system.</p>
<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers.

<h3>How Are "Point Of Sale" (POS) Systems Different From A Cash Register Muncie Indiana</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers. But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy. If POS software is the brains, then restaurant POS hardware is the brawn. It's very likely that Vend will play nice with the printers, scanners, credit card readers, and POS equipment you already have. For complicated functions like employee time tracking and synchronized inventory management, the user can make use of this system.</p>

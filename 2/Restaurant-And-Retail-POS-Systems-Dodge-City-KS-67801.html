<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on. The costs of implementing multiple disparate systems and getting them to work together in harmony is prohibitive for all but the largest retail businesses.</p>
<p>Most free POS software will only operate on a limited number of POS pieces of hardware. Thrive POS: This vendor offers the best POS system for pizza restaurants. Alexandria POS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as easy to use interface and programming services.

Common POS systems include a computer, receipt printer, lockable cash drawer, a scanner to read the bar code, a magnetic swipe reader and a modem and pole display. POS software companies can be found right online with just a simple search, and you will even find open source POS software, but again I suggest that you stay far away from it. They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>

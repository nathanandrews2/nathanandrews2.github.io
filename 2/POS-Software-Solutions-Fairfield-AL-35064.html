<p>When choosing the right retail point-of-sale system (POS) for your business, it is essential to understand what type of system will best meet your needs. Over the last few months they have shifted their company from a small business to a corporation that does not care about their individual customers. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.</p>
<p>I use livepos in my store, it has the features I need to run my business. Apply surcharges or discounts and accept cash, credit cards, account sales and more. Although we don't sell Apple iPads, our restaurant POS software works on tablets running Windows 8 or Windows 10. Your wait staff can quickly and easily take orders on tablets and immediately translate them to the kitchen. Online ordering â€” Customers love having the ability to order food online, so it makes sense to get in on the action.</p>
<h2>What Is Point Of Sale (POS) Software Fairfield</h2>

For small businesses, trends like mobile payments and mobile loyalty programs are especially relevant to product selection. Modern POS vary widely, from hardware for scanning credit cards that connects directly to your smartphone, to complete systems with terminals and cash drawers.</p>
<p>Software as a service (SaaS) essentially allows business owners to access add-on products to existing computers over a robust internet connection, and are an economical alternative to hardware purchases. With Mink Foodiee in-depth reporting and analytics, view real-time reports from anywhere, anytime, and make quick data-driven decisions for your restaurant. It's a great choice for people running a business both online and face-to-face, but the backend and frontend may feel more cumbersome than other POS systems designed for face-to-face sales primarily.</p>

<p>Free POS Software can be used as a replacement to similar third-party versions employed in common retail establishments. Credit card processing rates through Lightspeed Payments are set at a predictable fee for all card types, including American Express: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (2.6% + $0.30 card not present). When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>
<p>Customer data capture and management are key in the development of our retail systems and Retail Pro allows for much improved processes and usability in terms of CRM and stock management. For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. Food and drink sectors like restaurants require a different set of features in the POS software than retailers.</p>
<p>It differs from a cash register in that it has advanced features that make it easier for you to manage sales data, inventory, customers and employees. The cost of POS systems varies greatly depending on the business type and how many terminals are needed. Once these computers were in place, the rapid evolution of today's sophisticated retail management systems began. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>

<p>Reports show a complete picture of restaurant operations and life cycles: menu consumption, reservation frequency, hours of high restaurant load, busiest tables, most active employees, payment methods, and automatic tax calculations. Another fast-growing standard is the near-field communications (NFC) transaction, which is an electronic payment system being popularized by mobile giants such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet ( at Google Pay) Making sure your POS system candidate can handle these new emerging systems is only half of the equation.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that if you will be accepting debit and credit cards (which are required by most businesses), you need a service that will process all of your payments. A specialized system with bar-specific features will do so much more for your business than a general POS. Features include appointment scheduling, employee management, inventory tracking, integrated payment processing, and gift card and loyalty programs.</p>

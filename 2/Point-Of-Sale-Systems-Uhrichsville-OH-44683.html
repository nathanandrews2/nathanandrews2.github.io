<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>

<p>The advanced POS solutions offer sales trends like seasonal demand in products and information related to stock management. Point-of-sale systems, or POS, are the retail software and hardware merchants use to process in-person transactions. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards.</p>

Since this is a cloud-based Point of Sales system, you can always check your inventory level and order new goods whether you are in the office, at home or on the go. You can control your inventory through streamlined reorder processes and easily transfer goods from one location to another.</p>

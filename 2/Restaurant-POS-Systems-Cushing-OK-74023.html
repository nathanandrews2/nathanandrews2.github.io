<p>The Point of Sale system from QuickBooks has always captured the attention and curiosity of many people. Swipe your customer's card and open a bar tab quickly. Cova is the perfect POS system for cannabis retailers. Select from complete solutions featuring QuickStore software and a Cash Drawer, Pole Display, Receipt Printer and Barcode Scanner. The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers. It's also complete with features such as financial data analysis, inventory management, customer loyalty programs, payment gateways, delivery management, and currency exchange.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>

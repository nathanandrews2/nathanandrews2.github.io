<p>The uAccept POS system from Workwell Technologies comes with a touchscreen, card reader, receipt printer and cash drawer. This can help attract repeat business and effectively help you market to interested customers. Since your ecommerce and in-store solution will be connected with Shopify POS, customers will have the ability to return or exchange an online purchase at a local retail location. If the POS system holds data on recent purchases at the supermarket, then in order to transfer that data to ERP, the employee will have to input that information again in the ERP system in order to ensure proper accounting of the supermarket's cash flow.</p>
<p>Harbortouch TablesideTM allows your restaurant's servers to input customer orders directly from the table via an Apple® iPad® for a dramatic increase in speed, service quality, and efficiency. Each time an item is ordered through the POS it is removed from the current inventory. Increase your sales and profitability by expanding your bar and alcohol business. For example, you may offer a self-service kiosk for patrons to purchase movie tickets, or you may have one to manage parking space time and payments.</p>

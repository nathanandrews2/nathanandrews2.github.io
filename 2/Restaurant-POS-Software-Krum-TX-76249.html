<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>
<h2>Hospitality Pos Systems Krum</h2>
<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. If the restaurant has primarily chosen a cloud-based POS system but their internet is not 100% reliable, they can connect an on-site server enabling the software to function when the internet is down and sync the data in the cloud when the internet is back up and running.</p>

Revel offers POS systems for retail, restaurants, bars, and quick-serve businesses. They're the software and hardware that a retail business needs to run their business.

<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included.
